# Emotion Under Lockdown: Fake Review Detection and COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project combines fake review detection with sentiment analysis to study emotional trends during the COVID-19 lockdown. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), it uses a BERT-based model to identify fake reviews and analyze public sentiments like anxiety, optimism, and frustration. The goal is to ensure trust in online platforms while understanding societal emotions during crises.

## Features:
Features
Fake Review Detection: Identifies fraudulent reviews using advanced NLP models.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes emotions in genuine reviews, focusing on the COVID-19 lockdown period.
Insights: Provides correlations between fake reviews and emotional exaggeration.

## Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Clean text (remove special characters, stopwords).
Tokenize and pad sequences.
Convert text to embeddings.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze tweet length and sentiment distribution.
Identify frequent words/hashtags.
Model Building:

Build Bi-directional LSTM with word embeddings.
Compile using SparseCategoricalCrossentropy and Adam.
Train and evan format for your notebook.he desired styling in your notebook.he desired styling in your notebook.

   Usage

1. Preprocess Data:
   - Run 'Corona_NLP_Train.csv' to clean and tokenize reviews.

2. Train the Model:
   - Using 'Corona_NLP_Train.csv' fine-tune BERT for fake review detection.

3. Analyze Sentiments:
   - Running and classifing sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral categories.

4. Visualize Results:
   - Generating graphs and word clouds for insights.

5. Deploy the Application:
    Running and Launching the web application and interact with the system.



 ## Dataset
 Reviews collected from platforms like Amazon, Yelp, and TripAdvisor during the COVID-19 lockdown.
 Ensure compliance with data privacy and platform-specific scraping guidelines.



 ## Challenges
 Handling imbalanced datasets for fake reviews.
 Capturing nuanced emotions related to COVID-19.
 Processing domain-specific language during the lockdown.



## Future Enhancements
 Extend analysis to social media data for broader sentiment insights.
 Implement multi-lingual support for global reviews.
 Use graph-based models for reviewer activity and relationshipÂ analysis.
